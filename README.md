# Python Assignment 4 - Group: Plain Product.
### Analyzing dataset from Plain Product : The Movie Dataset.
* This program analyzes a movie dataset and answer some questions about the movies: [Link to assignment](https://github.com/MikkelHansen95/dataset/blob/master/README.md) 
* Questiones like how many movie are rated adult, which english action movie had the biggest revenue and so on.
* This program also produces some 2D and 3D plots to illustrate some of the relationships between the movie data.

### Procedure to run the program:
* Clone the project into your computer.
* How to use the program:
  * In a command prompt or bash with Python available, use the following command together with the URL to the CSV file: 
  * python main.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/planetsig/ufo-reports/master/csv-data/ufo-scrubbed-geocoded-time-standardized.csv

### Dependencies:
* Python - Anaconda Distribution 
* *In order to make sure that all librabies are present for a problem free execution of the software, we recommend using an Anaconda distribution of Python. But the software will probably also run with other distributiions, but then libraries such as Requests might need to be installed.*

### Using the program should result in the following output:

* **Console output:**
Most spotted place is seattle and was spotted 525

Number of observation over time look at plot 0

Top 5 shapes of ufo [('light', 16565), ('triangle', 7865), ('circle', 7608), ('fireball', 6208),      ('other', 5649)]

Watch the plots


* **The CSV file should be downloaded to the 'csv' folder.**

* **Plotting images should be created in .png format and found in the 'plots' folder as:** 

 

* **OBS:** *When creating the plot it should be displayed in a new window and the program execution will halt until this window is closed.*
